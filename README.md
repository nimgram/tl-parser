# TL Parser

This is the TL Parser used by Nimgram. It is able to parse a subset of the TL Language (.tl) that is used by MTProto's "layers".

Since the parser is incomplete, it means that it is unable to read some elements of the TL Language, for example, [polymorphic types](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/TL-polymorph).

Special thanks to [Grammers](https://github.com/Lonami/grammers) for inspiring the creation of this parser.
